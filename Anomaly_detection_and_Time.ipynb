        "Answer: Anomaly Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "Anomaly Detection is a data analysis technique used to identify data points, patterns, or observations that deviate significantly from normal behavior. These unusual patterns are called anomalies or outliers and often indicate critical events such as fraud, system failures, intrusions, or errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Anomalies\n",
        "1. Point Anomalies\n",
        "\n",
        "A point anomaly occurs when a single data instance is significantly different from the rest of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "In a credit card transaction dataset, a transaction of ₹5,00,000 when the user usually spends ₹500–₹5,000.\n",

        "A sudden spike in temperature sensor data showing 120°C when normal values are around 25–30°C.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Contextual Anomalies\n",
        "\n",
        "A contextual anomaly is an observation that is anomalous only in a specific context (such as time, location, or season).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "25°C temperature is normal in summer but anomalous in winter.\n",
        "\n",
        "High website traffic at 2 PM is normal, but the same traffic at 3 AM may be anomalous.\n",
        "\n",

        "3. Collective Anomalies\n",
        "\n",
        "A collective anomaly occurs when a group of related data points is anomalous, even though individual points may appear normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "A series of small network packets sent repeatedly could indicate a DDoS attack, even though each packet alone seems normal.\n",
